# GitHubREST-Espresso

### Description
This app implements GitHub REST Service using Retrofit library and I tested the UI (User Interface) with the framework Espresso.

You can look for a GitHub user that you want and the app will show you information about this user and a list of their followers.

You can also test the UI running the ApplicationTest java class. I used Espresso testing framework to open the app, type a user and look for an specific follower.

##### Command line Git
Open your terminal, navigate to your working directory, use `git clone` to get a copy of the repo.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nalcalag/GitHubREST-Espresso.git
